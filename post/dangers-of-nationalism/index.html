        <blockquote>
<p>They climbed inside their boxes. They settled with their trinkets. They neither looked nor learned much more and close their lids up tight.</p>

<p>Once they fastened up their boxes, they smiled there inside and they all thought in their darkness that the world was clear and bright.</p>

<p>Dawud Wharnsby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nationalism in its purist form is not wrong; there is nothing wrong with being patriotic about where one comes from. However, with Brexit and Trumpexit closing their borders, it seems like the dream of a unified planet      coming true is far from today.</p>

<p>You see, globalisation has many benefits such as alleviating poverty, helping refugees, economic growth, and an increase in cultural and genetic diversity. Countries like USA have experienced great success by opening its borders. Look at the USA Olympic team, they dominate in terms of gold medals and their team is very diverse and multicultural; genetic diversity leads to the genetic advantage which can only benefit society.</p>

<p>However, in recent times, terms like &lsquo;domestic grown terrorism&rsquo; and &lsquo;radical Islamists&rsquo; have been thrown around by the media attempting to sway the public opinion against globalisation. In fact, this has become such a norm, that it has turned countries against taking in refugees to help with probably the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.nz/take-action/syria-crisis">Greatest Humanitarian Crisis of Our Time</a>, simply because of their religion.</p>

<p><img src="ClJD4cdUoAA189f.jpg" alt="" /><em>I wonder if this Is how Trump&rsquo;s Muslim ban works</em></p>

<p>One in every 5 people born in Europe is a Muslim. Islam is the second largest religion in Canada. This means that as a non-Muslim, chances are, you are good friends with a Muslim. Think for a second, if Muslims were out to kill non-Muslims, why are you not dead yet? Why has your best friend, a Muslim, not killed you? So while you are against taking in Muslim refugees, or non-Muslim refugees, think about it for a second, chances are you are very close friends with a visible minority. Are you really their friend then?</p>

<p><img src="143884794916043724179.jpg" alt="" /><em>Even Nicholas Hoult looks kinda confused by that</em></p>

<p>As best said by the Dalai Lama, there is no such thing as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe2X95o4yIE">Muslim Terrorist!</a>. You see while we divide ourselves and lock ourselves in between borders, we have to remember that as Homo sapiens, we all share this earth, the sky, the water, the very air we breathe. We tend to forget these things for some reason and pride ourselves with our idea of nationalism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the world is not a box. There&rsquo;s no lid, no doors, no cardboard flaps or locks. And everything in nature from the cloud to the rocks, is a piece of a puzzle of the purpose of man. It&rsquo;s a piece of the peace that we&rsquo;ll find.</p>

<p>I see you and you see me. Why not come out and be free? Faith and flowers wilt and die if they are hidden from the sky?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got to tip the lid and let some sunshine in. Realise our own faults too - stop being so judgmental of others and get ourselves out of the dogmatic boxes we have trapped ourselves in. Think about  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OvbWGgdiEU">The People of the Boxes</a> next time you are about to make such claims against humanitarian aid, globalisation, or just helping out people in need.</p>
